## Testing

Tailwind CSS is used for styling and a local Node.js HTTP server is used for testing. A [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is used for development and all requisite npm packages should be installed.

To run the development environment:

    npm run dev

You can now navigate to http://localhost:8080 for testing.

## Building

To build for distribution:

    npm run dist
